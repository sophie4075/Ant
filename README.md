# Ant
## Project Overview
This project, titled MyTask, is a university assignment that demonstrates a basic "Hello World" program and uses Apache Ant to manage the build process. The project includes tasks for compiling, cleaning, fetching dependencies, creating a JAR file, generating documentation, and running tests. Additionally, this project demonstrates the functionalities of Git. Below are the screenshots showing how the repository was set up and managed using Git.

## Prerequisites
Before running this project, ensure you have the following installed on your system:
- Java Development Kit (JDK)
- Apache Ant

## Project Structure
- src/: Contains the source code (.java files).
- classes/: Output directory for compiled classes.
- docs/: Directory for generated Javadocs.
- lib/: Directory for external libraries.
- build.xml: The Ant build file that defines all tasks.
- Build Tasks: The build.xml file defines several tasks to manage the project:


## Notes
The main class for the project is HelloWorld. Ensure this class exists in the src directory.
Test classes should be named with the suffix Test to be picked up by the JUnit task.
Adjust the URLs in the build.xml file if the dependency URLs change or if using different versions.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates a simple Ant build process for a Java application. The provided build.xml file contains tasks for common operations such as compilation, testing, and documentation generation. Modify the file as needed for more complex projects.
